# AWS Server Tagging Tool

This script takes an input of an excel file full of tagging information for AWS servers. This excel file should simply have column named "Instance ID", which is the ID of the server. Then, there should be multiple other columns with the column name being the tag name, and the column value being the tag value.

The three inputs for this script is as follows: filePath, sheetName, and listOfWantedCategories. 

* filePath is the file path to the excel file. 
* sheetName is the name of the sheet you want to use within the excel file. 
* listOfWantedCategories is a list of all categories from the excel file that you want to have imported in as an AWS server tag. This functionality enables the user to provide a general excel file of servers and tag attributes and only update some of those tags.
