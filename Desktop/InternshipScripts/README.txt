All of the scripts in this folder have documentation that explain how they work, what inputs the script takes,
and the output of the script.

All these scripts were written and tested by Kamila Wickramarachchi during his internship at Live Nation.

Thank you to Byron Brummer for helping test some scripts and fix them up.

I am no longer with the company (as of 9/15/2019) as my internship is finished. Goodbye!
