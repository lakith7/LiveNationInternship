# There is two input values for this script.
#
# The first input value (workspaceScriptFilePath) is the file path to the xls output of the
# WorkSpaceInfoCollectorScript.py.
#
# The second input value is adOutputFilePath, which is simply the file path to the output from the active directory
# script.
# Make SURE to delete the first row of the output file, as it is unnecessary data that will break the script.
# The active directory csv file can be retrieved by running the following script for each profile and region
# in the active directory (powershell):
#
#  $List = @('Rob.Caudillo', 'vivian.wang', 'Venu.Malyala', 'Christine.Chu', 'Matt.Jensen', 'Stacy.Price', 'curtis.li', 'Kushal.Gupta', 'kaushlendra.bais', 'jquiring')

#  $Incorrect = @()
#  foreach ($Item in $List) {
#      try {$Users += Get-ADUser $Item -Properties mail,manager,enabled} catch{$Incorrect += $Item}
#  }
#  $Users | Export-Csv -Path .\Desktop\UserInfo.csv
#  Out-File -FilePath .\Desktop\Incorrect.txt -InputObject $Incorrect
#
# Replace the elements of $List with the list of users that is outputted in the
