# This repo contains all the scripts I wrote as an intern at Live Nation Entertainment

Each of my big projects are separated into their own folders and each folder has a ReadMe that explain how the scripts work, what inputs the scripts take, and the output of the scripts.

## Acknowledgments

* Thank you very much to Byron Brummer for helping me write my scripts! I truly would not have been able to get these projects to work without him!
